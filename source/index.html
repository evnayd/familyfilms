                The action takes place in the future, in one lovely town. There
                is everything for life: beautiful houses, cars, shops, trees and
                grass. Everything is made of plastic. People have forgotten that
                there were real trees on the Earth. The truth is that people buy
                air to breathe. But they are used to it. But one day one dreamy
                girl suddenly told her friend that she would like to see a real
                tree. This is how the whole story began.

                Robot WALL-E from year to year diligently works on the deserted
                Earth, clearing our planet from the mountains of garbage left
                behind by people who flew into space. He does not even imagine
                that incredible events will happen very soon, thanks to which he
                will meet friends, rise to the stars and even be able to change

                their native Earth.

                Little boy August Pullman is the same as other boys of his age -
                he loves to go to his friends' birthdays and to play computer
                games. On the other hand, he is not at all like other boys of
                his age. Firstly, August never went to a regular school - from
                the first grade, his mother taught him at home. Secondly, August
                underwent 27 operations. Due to a very rare genetic error,
                August has no face. And such a boy should go to school. For the
                first time. To the ordinary children.
